    As religion is the opiate of the masses, luxuries are the opiates of the powerful. 
<hr>
Centralization is more powerful and efficient, but decentralization is more enduring and reliable. 
<hr>
Keep one eye on the present and one on the future because the winds of change are inevitable. 
<hr>
The power of a group or relationship is akin to a loan as it is not yours but merely borrowed from others.
<hr>
You are nothing but that which you are in isolation. 
<hr>
You own nothing because ownership cannot exist without the acknowledgement of others. 
<hr>
Culture is decentralized and as such you cannot impose it. 
<hr>
If you try and fail, you fail once. If you fail to try, you fail forever. 
Therefore, it is usually better to try and fail then to fail to try.
<hr>
You can choose to die at any time. 
So why have you chosen to live?
<hr>
Avoid perfection. 
Master the process.
<hr>
Never stop asking why.
<hr>
Rights, morality, and the law are luxuries of those with the power to assert them.
<hr>
A desire for revenge is the purest expression of pain.
<hr>
Respect lives at the conjunction of love and fear.
<hr>
The key to a successful relationship is to be humble. 
It’s not a fantasy adventure and neither person is so perfect or special that they are entitled to be treated better than the other.
<hr>
Like fire, power is neither good nor evil, merely dangerous. 
Like sheep, people are easily led. 
Like cats, individuals are selfish. 
Like dogs and wolves, humans are omnivorous predators.
<hr>
Long ago ownership was equivalent to responsibility. 
Today it is synonymous with exploitation.
<hr>
Early to bed, early to rise; makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise. 
This is because going to bed early and waking up early builds self-discipline, which is the one true key to health, wealth, and wisdom.
<hr>
Driving change isn’t about getting people to accept it, it’s about implementing it anyways and preventing people from stopping you.
<hr>
Top down, centralized hierarchies are the most stable, enduring, and capable of enacting external change. 
Bottom up, decentralized non-hierarchies are the most adaptable, internally changeable, and turbulent.
<hr>
There is no good or evil, only consequences.
<hr>
It’s not your fault things are the way they are. 
It’s your fault if things stay that way.
<hr>
Usually, doing nothing is the least counterproductive thing you can do.
<hr>
Those who cannot refrain from playing with the fires of power will eventually get burned by them.
<hr>
Nothing is more universally human than war. 
Consequently, the end of war is the end of humanity.
<hr>
A purpose of life is to strive towards or for what matters to you.
<hr>
Internal politics occur when an environment is stable enough for individuals to plan for their personal future, 
and when their advancement is more contingent on their social capabilities than their aptitudes.
<hr>
Obtain a monopoly on either fear or love in a person and you can accomplish anything. 
Obtain anything less than a monopoly and you will accomplish nothing which is not also convenient for that person.
<hr>
For the person that does nothing, time is either the greatest ally or the greatest adversary. 
Which, depends entirely on whether they decide to use time or let time use them.
<hr>
All decisions come with a tradeoff. 
Those that don’t are either not decisions or they are lies.
<hr>
Genocide is and always has been a shortcut to harmony for those who are too impatient and undisciplined to pursue it harmoniously.
<hr>
The self-empowerment of women is the emancipation of men, 
for an empowered woman that provides for herself has no need to legally bind a man to her to provide for her. 
Thus in a society of empowered and independent women, any man who surrenders or seeks to surrender his independence to a woman is a fool. 
<hr>
Help comes to those who help themselves. 
Consequently, the best way to help others is to help them to help themselves. 
Don’t solve people’s problems for them; give them the knowledge, skills, and resources they need to solve their own problems.
<hr>
Individuals don’t change, they just get better at convincing others that they have changed while discovering who they truly are.
<hr>
The best lies are true because people are less likely to believe the truth. 
Consequently, those with the most integrity have the most to hide.
<hr>
There are four types of bondage: (chattel) slavery, debt bondage, the bond of marriage, and the law.
<hr>
All that begins must end, but death is the beginning of life. 
All life begins with the death and decay of the life that came before it. 
Imagine if nobody died. 
There would be no need to have children to replace those that died. 
Thus as lifetimes are extended birthrates decline because the increased supply of people is accompanied by a reduced demand for them.
<hr>
Those who study philosophy without also studying history are blind to the impact that a philosopher’s times, culture, language, gender, 
and even personal life may have on their philosophy as well as the role it may have in explaining it.
<hr>
The purpose of religion is to ensure that you live a moral life. 
Morality is intrinsically determined by the truth of reality. 
If hell does not exist, then you cannot go to it to be punished after you die. 
However, the reality is that there is no truth, and therefore everything is permitted. 
Consequently, the ideal religion tells you to do what you were going to do anyways. 
In other words, the ideal religion disassociates you from responsibility for your choices and actions.
<hr>
Sentience is the interface between reality and unreality.
<hr>
Sometimes, the best way to avoid losing is to admit defeat. 
Sometimes, the best way to win is to forsake victory.
<hr>
Americans are notoriously idealistic. 
Americans are also notoriously bad at nation building. 
Is this a coincidence? 
That depends on the practicality of idealism to the nation being built.
<hr>
Only the enlightened and the insane know what lies beyond for them.
<hr>
The reason young people are usually liberal and old people are usually conservative is that young people are just 
starting their lives and have much to gain and little to lose whereas old people have much to lose and little to gain.
<hr>
The key to successfully manipulating someone is setting up the situation so that you succeed even if the manipulation fails.
<hr>
Control yourself before someone else does.
<hr>
Ritual is an essential component of an individual’s existence not because of the effect of the ritual on the world, 
but because of the effect of the ritual on the individual. 
Rituals are placebo actions which help the individual to feel in control of their world in situations where their lack of control discomforts them.
<hr>
The holiest and most sacred place on Earth is your body. 
Nurture it, worship it, improve it, protect it.
<hr>
Temples, churches, mosques, and monasteries are merely places that provide essential services to the individual.
<hr>
A purpose of life is to seek out collective experiences from which you can change the world.
<hr>
Creativity requires individualism, yet implementation requires collective action.
<hr>
Live life so that you would want to live it the same way again.
<hr>
Nobody escapes life unscathed.
<hr>
Happiness is the journey, not the destination and the action is the reward.
<hr>
There is no pleasure without pain.
<hr>
Never be content with contentment, so go beyond mediocrity.
<hr>
An übermensch is someone who can define and implement their own goals and journeys for themselves, rather than the goals set for them by society or others.
<hr>
Gods are not magical and mysterious beings, but rather ideals for us to strive towards. 
If you want something, create a god for it and do only as Your god commands. 
Believe not in Your god, but in Yourself, the god’s creator.
<hr>
Go beyond independence, find Your resonance.
<hr>
To deny Your own passions is to deny the very thing that makes us human.
<hr>
Morality is inextricable from what we believe the truth to be. 
But the truth is, there is no truth, therefore there is no morality, therefore everything is permitted.
<hr>
The chains of bondage pull both ways. 
Thus weakness becomes strength and strength becomes weakness. 
So long as both the slave and the master are bound to each other either may govern the other. 
Only after the chains of bondage are broken, will the master and the slave be able to look upon each other without fear in their eyes.
<hr>
Conquer your fear or it will conquer you. 
The greatest weakness of fear is peace, harmony, stability, and prosperity for fear feeds on the imagined potential of conflict and chaos.
<hr>
One must always examine the extremes of that which we suggest to be laws or principles, for it is only in extreme cases that we truly understand the consequences of our suggestions.
<hr>
You’re not here to make choices, that has already been done. 
Rather, you’re here to understand why you made those choices because the more you understand about your choices, the more you understand about both yourself and the world.
<hr>
All people with power want more power. 
This is not because power corrupts, but because the only way to protect the power you have is to add to it. 
For if power cannot protect itself, is it really power? 
Such are the mechanics of the black hole of power: 
no light in this world may escape its gravity except that which it has already consumed or those who maintain a barrier of the vastest of distances.
<hr>
Evil is merely an equal and opposite reaction to good and one cannot exist without the other. 
Thus in case of one’s triumph over the other, both will either cease to exist or be reborn in other forms.
<hr>
Why do I persist? 
Because I choose to.
<hr>
Military organizations are created in order to exert power via the control of life and death. 
Military organizations are typically commanded by one person who understands both what the organization’s members want and how to get it for them. 
Governments are created to protect their subjects from the exertion of power by military organizations. 
Governments accomplish this through the creation of a military organization whose commander and members share the government’s purpose. 
A military organization’s loyalty to a government is always contingent on the government enabling the organization to meet the needs of its members. 
A government’s loyalty to a military organization is always contingent on the organization’s obedience to the government.
<hr>
Every day of your life is a struggle against fear. 
The days that you win, you are free. 
The days that you lose, you are a slave to it. 
The only thing you need to win this struggle is to know that you 
Already 
have the power to win. 
You simply need to choose to use it to overcome your fears, reservations, and hesitations.
<hr>
Ideas may be bulletproof, but the people who think them are not. 
If you want an idea to last forever you must write it down and make sure it is spread enough that no book burning 
will ever be adequate to eliminate it and no genocide will be capable of erasing its memory.
<hr>
Time is money, so don’t waste it and be sure to spend it wisely.
<hr>
People rule the world.
Therefore people are the only monsters worth fearing.
<hr>
Every garden is separated from the rest of the world by a dividing line of some sort. 
This line separates the order from the chaos because people enjoy feeling like their world is under their control. 
But what of the chaos beyond? 
Does nature not too have its own laws and order? 
What then is order, but a fantasy created to satiate an individual’s need for control. 
A need that arises to balance out the fear of the uncontrollable that arises from the uncertainties in life. 
Thus the solution to fear is to develop an understanding of the order behind the chaos rather 
than an inherently temporary control over a chaos that obeys its own laws before Yours. 
This is the order of the universe that produces chaos.
<hr>
Even if the product of your labors is for naught, the labor itself will render, like a tattoo, 
another product unto you: the knowledge and perspectives of experience which are so rare and unique 
because they can be gained no other way, communicated to no other person, and are an asset only to you, its bearer.
<hr>
When you dream of a past love changing, you are recognizing that they were never the person you wanted them to be, but only a dream. 
That alone tells you that you were never meant to be.
<hr>
We play with the toys we are given.
<hr>
Parenting isn’t about raising good children, it’s about raising good adults. 
Likewise, nation building isn’t about building an economy, it’s about building mutual trust in the community. 
The best way to establish mutual trust in the community is with public lending libraries. 
The principle behind these libraries is the same fundamental principle behind successful governments. 
Mutual trust enables resource sharing which enables shared benefits which further grow mutual trust.
<hr>
Do not hesitate. 
Everything important happens in the time between thought and action.
<hr>
The only people who get upset when you set boundaries are those who benefited from you having none.
<hr>
Power has and always will be built using the existence of walls, physical or otherwise.
<hr>
Control yourself or be controlled. 
There are no other options. 
The best way to control yourself is to control your habits. 
Define Your habits because Your habits define You. 
They control where you go in life and how you get there.
<hr>
There is no magic, there is only economics.
<hr>
Philosophers explain reality using fantasy. 
Scientists explain reality using reality.
Artists explain fantasy using fantasy.
Psychologists explain fantasy using reality.
<hr>
The tragedy in death lies not in the end of your life, but in the world’s loss of your usefulness to it. 
Thus if you lived a life of usefulness, you will die content and should direct the world to celebrate the contributions you are most proud of giving to it. 
If you failed to live a life of usefulness, you will fear your death and you will inevitably be forgotten.
<hr>
Time is simultaneously the scarcest and most abundant of resources. 
It can never be grown, nor rationed; only spent. 
We are each born with an abundance of it, yet it is the only thing we have to invest which earns us no interest.
<hr>
Some of us wait all our life for the opportunity to throw it away and possibly end it. 
We look forward to it because we want this to give our life meaning, because we need meaning in our life more than we need life itself.
<hr>
In a society not constrained by a single universal type of relationship, 
the ideal relationship is that defined and agreed to be mutually beneficial by the participating parties. 
Consequently, communication between the participating parties is essential for an agreement on 
the nature and expectations for the relationship to be conclusively reached. 
As time goes on and the circumstances of their lives change, the continuing importance of 
communication only grows as the participating parties must either adapt and evolve their 
relationship to their mutual satisfaction, or end it for their individual satisfaction. 
<hr>
It is always better to leave an unhealthy or disadvantageous relationship than to stay for the sake of another. 
If all efforts at communication and change have failed, then leaving an unhealthy or disadvantageous relationship is not only better, but imperative.
<hr>
A rule with exceptions is no rule at all.
<hr>

There is no best and there is no worst. 
There is only that which is appropriately or inappropriately suited for the given context.
<hr>
Businesses flock to their customers, like sex workers flock to soldiers. 
Thus jobs don’t create wealth, but rather wealth creates jobs.
<hr>
There exists within each of us various quantities of order and chaos. 
If you do not bring balance to the order and chaos within yourself then you will be ruled by the greater of the two.
<hr>
Everyone has the power to change the world, but no one has control over how they change the world.
<hr>
Anyone who is indispensable and knows it will probably be an inconvenient asshole. 
Inconvenient because they can’t be disposed of and an asshole because they know it.
<hr>
Love life, the universe, and everything not for what life can give you, but for what you can give it.
<hr>
Life, creation, and growth is the process of the centralization and exhaustion of an environment’s resources. 
Death, decay, and destruction is the process of the decentralization and renewal of an environment’s resources. 
Life and death cannot exist without each other. 
In fact, it is obvious to us that only that which lives, may die and must die. 
What is considerably less obvious to us is that only that which dies, may live and must live. 
Thus, death, destruction, and decay are the vital and necessary precursors to any life, creation, and growth.
<hr>
You should not be in the service of society, society should be in the service of you.
<hr>
You must first destroy who you were before you may create the person you choose to become. 
When you were young and immature you were given a name; now you are older and have matured. 
You must must purge that name from your life to kill the child that you were. Only then can you choose a new name and create the person you choose to be.
<hr>
There exist two fundamental halves of the universe: reality and unreality. 
Reality is everything that can be perceived, understood, explained, and objectified. 
Reality is the deterministic universe where all effects are the results of causes, 
where all choices are calculated by the machine of the body as an extension of the machine of the universe, 
where time must proceed linearly, space must separate the universe, and we must interpret existence as a matter of dimensions. 
Unreality is everything that can be intuited but not perceived, suspected but not understood, felt but not explained, 
and like a penumbra known only in relation to that which is not itself. 
Unreality is the uncertain universe where all causes are the result of their effects, 
where there is no time, space, or matter, 
where the machine of the universe and subsequently the machine of the body is willed into existence by the universe’s choice to exist as such. 
Unreality is where you go when you die and where you are created from when you are born. 
Unreality is not a place, but a state of being and feeling. 
It is everywhere and nowhere. 
It is the beginning and end of a book and the silver lining of the cloud. 
It is unobservable and nonnegatable, null and infinite. 
It is free will itself, independent and indomitable.
<hr>
Historically, the platonic state has always had two powers at its disposal: 
the coercive (military) power necessary to assert its independence from other states and the 
administrative (economic/bureaucratic/informatic) power necessary to maintain, support, and sustain the coercive power. 
The powers to create (legislative), judge (judicial), and enforce (executive) laws are merely the consequences of reorienting 
and asserting the coercive and administrative powers upon the people within the state in addition to those outside the state. 
When this occurs the coercive power is commonly known as the police power. 
Thus governments (as known during and up to the writing of this work) regard domestic and foreign policy as two sides of the same coin: 
a means of ensuring their continued existence and power at the expense of all others. 
Consequently, the initial purpose of the state (to protect its people) is corrupted by its quest to maintain the requisite monopoly on the power perceived necessary to do so. 
In this manner Hobbes’ Leviathan becomes the Orwellian monster it sought to protect its people from. 
Despite the opinions of critics of the centralization of power, decentralizing the monopoly on power does not solve this problem as it only decentralizes the monster. 
The only viable solution to this dilemma is to permanently divorce and isolate the coercive power 
from the administrative power of the state so that the coercive power may be easily limited, reduced, and if necessary neutered by the administrative power 
should it attempt to assert itself upon the people the state is supposed to protect.
<hr>
Laws are codes of behavior that the platonic state asserts upon its people. 
Because the people do not usually assert these standards and behaviors upon themselves the state must 
necessarily assert them using (usually) administrative force initially and coercive force secondly. 
Thus democratic states exist as proxies of the people to enforce their own will upon themselves through an external agent. 
The absurdity (not to mention inefficiency) of this arrangement is inevitably realized by the people, 
who eventually forsake the state in favor of simply asserting their will upon themselves in an anarchy without the trouble of going through the bureaucracy of a proxy. 
Consequently, the existence of the lawmaking platonic state is ultimately doomed once the people get the laws they want. 
Therefore, the only viable state is an undemocratic one, yet paradoxically, states can only exist if their people choose to allow them to.
<hr>
Most philosophers are statists in the sense of the platonic state. 
That is they believe in a state where a philosopher ought to make the laws and these laws are then asserted upon everyone else. 
In other words, like Plato they too dream of utopias.
<hr>
Nietsche’s insight was that striving towards values, ideals, and virtues defined by God is no longer rational or good enough.
His solution was to simply relocate the source of the values, virtues, and ideals from God to the individual. 
This is highly convenient for societies transitioning away from a belief in God as it enables 
individuals to maintain their traditional virtues, values, and ideals at their own discretion while also accepting, 
if not necessarily placing a greater value upon, those who choose to create their own virtues, values, and ideals like the Übermensch does. 
Thus Nietsche, in his advocacy for continued adherence to virtues, values, and ideals, 
has simply taken the core spirit of Hegelian German Idealism and decentralized/individualized it so it remains relevant in a world where God no longer plays a significant role.
Unfortunately, the price of individualization of one's values is a loss of the sense of community created by shared values 
and potentially the enstrangement from others who unknowningly share the individual's values.  
<hr>
Like hoarding gold, investing in property is only a good investment so long as the supply remains constrained and the currency continues to be inflated/devalued.
<hr>
Property value taxes naturally incentivize sprawling horizontal growth because property owners are penalized with a greater tax increase for vertically developing their property. 
Land value taxes (based on a lot’s area) naturally incentivize dense vertical growth because property owners are penalized with a greater tax increase for horizontally 
developing their property (through further land acquisition). 
Lot perimeter taxes (based on the lot’s perimeter) naturally incentivize larger individual lot sizes.
<hr>
Starvation makes even the bitterest medicine sweeter.
<hr>
Nothing is sacred except that which you choose to be. 
Only children believe that what is sacred to them must be sacred to everyone else as well.
<hr>
Laws exist to divide people into the groups of us and them so that one group may believe itself 
righteous and justified in their persecution, enslavement, displacement, and oppression of the other.
<hr>
All oppression occurs out of sight.
<hr>
The purpose of the mind is to satisfy the needs, desires, and passions of the individual. 
When these have all been satisfied then the mind can become depressed because it has nothing else to do. 
There are two possible solutions to getting out of this depression. 
Our ability to empathize enables us to experience the needs, desires, and passions of others and consequently give our mind something to do again. 
Alternatively, we can turn our mind to the future and put it to work preventing problems and prematurely satisfying our needs, desires, and passions.
<hr>
All addictions are a form of slavery.
<hr>
Revenge begins where forgiveness and communication end.
<hr>
The greatest leaders understand that in the right conditions any weakness can be turned into a strength and any strength can be turned into a weakness.
<hr>
Fear is the most powerful and controlling slavery.
<hr>
There are two ways to spell corruption. 
If the customer is a person, it is bribery; but if the customer is a group or corporation, then it is lobbying.
<hr>
States where the administrative power utilizes a gold or silver currency are unable to divorce the 
administrative power from the coercive because the coercive may coerce the administration into surrendering its coin.
<hr>
All blind men must always walk, for running is simply too dangerous to them.
<hr>
Harmony, order, and law cannot be imposed, only chosen; so ask yourself, have you chosen the laws that others want you to obey?
<hr>
There’s nothing quite like flirting with disaster to inspire change.
<hr>
Work expands to fill the time available for its completion. 
Consequently, managing efficiency is a matter of managing expectations.
<hr>
All relationships that are ended by their participants are ended thus because of unmet expectations. 
Therefore the key to a successful relationship is clearly communicating your expectations for the relationship both regularly and at the outset.
However, communicating your expectations hinges on knowing your expectations, so it is imperative that 
you take the time to know yourself before searching for a relationship so that you may know your expectations.
<hr>
The desire for growth and change in societies waxes and wanes, but the reliance on and need for stability is perpetual as few thrive when their government and civilization collapses.
<hr>
Women seek out men with authority, money, and power for the same reason that men seek attractive women, 
evolution has taught them that mates associated with these factors increase the likelihood of reproductive success.
<hr>
It’s only after we’ve lost everything that we’re free to do anything, otherwise the things you own end up owning you. 
Thus, freedom can only be found in forsaking ownership.
<hr>
There is no such thing as a one person civilization. 
From this we can infer that not only does a civilization’s existence depend on multiple people, 
but that it also depends on the stable maintenance of relationships between these people. 
Therefore if one wants to understand the rise and fall of civilizations, 
an adequate understanding of human relationships is necessary since human relationships are the bones of civilization.
<hr>
If you’re not convinced, then don’t talk yourself into it.
<hr>
When socialism comes to America it will not be preached by revolutionaries, but sold by businesses. 
Why? Because, if you want something to be accepted it cannot be given away cheaply, otherwise people will assume it has little real value. 
Therefore it must come at a price.
<hr>
The more attractive someone is the more chaos they are hiding inside. 
Why? Because beauty is a proxy for control and the more control someone asserts over themself the more they have within themself that they think must be controlled.
Thus when people see beauty they are attracted not by it, but by what they assume it must be hiding.
<hr>
Life is defined by paradoxes and lived through our relationships with them. 
All human motivation is ultimately the manifestation of some variation of fear for 
our individual existence and the desire to propagate our individuality, physical or otherwise. 
Thus people will follow authority when they fear the consequences of failing to do so or 
when they see a means towards propagating their individuality in their doing so. 
The means of propagation varies from person to person and may be sexual desire, 
the desire for power, the desire to influence others, or even the desire to be remembered; 
but it is always some type of desire. 
All people are different and have different combinations of desires, 
yet we find combinations of identical methods of expressing these desires in order to find an 
equilibrium between the supply and demand of our desires and our ability to satiate them.
<hr>
To become a god to others you must disassociate yourself from the mundane; 
not because you are a god, but because you must appear to be a god.
<hr>
Manliness, adulting, and independence are all different words that describe one thing: committing to your decisions, opinions, and yourself.
Manliness was decisiveness, empathy, communication, commitment, action, responsibility, and the willingness to actually pursue one’s goals. 
But what we used to call manliness we now call leadership, because these virtues are not restricted to those with a penis.
<hr>
Propaganda is an illusion that works best on those who want to believe and worship because they crave the comfort it brings them.
<hr>
Death is like the end of a story. 
It is inevitable, necessary for the story to have meaning, and you can’t enjoy the journey if you’re consumed with avoiding it.
<hr>
We are all slaves to our fears, yet without fears we are incapable of independence. 
Thus true freedom can only be achieved by identifying, then understanding, then managing our fears. 
True power over oneself can be achieved when one knows when to fight one’s fears and when to encourage them. 
Consequently, true power over others can be achieved when one knows how to manage the fears of others.
<hr>
Individuals truly achieve their full human condition when they produce without being compelled by the physical necessity of selling themself as a commodity.
<hr>
Love not what your lover gives you, but to experience the unique act of loving that person.
<hr>
Businesses and their owners are like dogs on leashes. 
Those owned by the people that run the business are the domesticated dogs. 
They’re just out to help themselves and they are constantly restrained by the leashes of reality. 
Those that are not owned by the people that run the business are the rabid, wild dogs. 
They too, are just out to help themselves, but they have no clear leash to restrain them.
<hr>
World War Two saw the advent of mechanized warfare and since then we have seen the mechanization of bureaucracy via computers and the internet. 
It is only inevitable that governments will eventually mechanize their bureaucracies to become what we might call the digital state.
<hr>
As far as China is concerned, Westerners are nothing more than Ghengis' Mongolians who’ve traded in their cavalry and bows for ships, guns, and finance.
<hr>
Those who manipulate others may become powerful, but those who manipulate themselves are indomitable.
<hr>
You are your flaws, quirks, obsessions, and idiosyncrasies. 
Without these you are perfect, but without these you are also no one. 
Strive not for perfection, but for improvement. 
So abandon perfection and be a better you.
<hr>
Excessive worrying is an addiction that impedes efficient problem solving.
<hr>
Some of the great ironies of reality are that 
the pursuit of perfection creates more imperfection than perfection, 
the pursuit of happiness creates more unhappiness than happiness, 
the pursuit of harmony creates more chaos and discord than harmony, 
and the pursuit of salvation creates more condemnation than salvation. 
Thus is the nature of entropy.
<hr>
Creating an organization is as simple as behaving as if it already exists and believing that it does.
Inventors will their ideas into existence, business owners will their companies into existence, and nations will their states into existence.
<hr>
The difference between a mob and an army is the logistical administration necessary to maintain and support the army.
<hr>
The great thing about the gold standard is that it is great for maintaining fiscal discipline. 
The problem with the gold standard is that it just isn’t great enough. 
In scarcity based economies, gold currencies can never be more stable, or more valuable than 
correctly executed time based currencies because you can always earn more gold in your lifetime, but you can never earn more time during your life.
<hr>
A government has failed its people when the people decide that succeeding in life is no longer about merit and hard work.

What is Justice? 
Justice is not punishment for a crime or balancing the scales, that is revenge. 
Justice is not about the dispassionate enforcement of the law whatever it may be, that is legalism and administration. 
Justice is not blind obedience to an authority simply because it is the rightful authority, that is tradition. 
Justice is fairness, and fairness, like comparative advantage, is always contextual and therefore never fixed. 
Thus fixing and perpetuating laws beyond the context of their creation is the height of folly, and the guarantor of stagnation.
<hr>
The root of all confidence is knowing that in the end you will succeed despite all obstacles and failures. 
The sooner you fail, the sooner you learn how to recover from failure and grow from it. 
Thus both confidence and success are born of adversity and failure.
<hr>
There is a distinct type of pain and suffering that those with no pain or suffering in their life must endure. 
It is a despair of meaning and purpose to life. 
For when you no longer have to struggle against life’s adversities to continue living, then what purpose remains in life? 
The answer of course is whatever purpose you choose, but the motivational power of this pales in comparison to the 
motivational power of our fundamental needs and that of being obligated to fulfill our commitments to those within our social in-group. 
Thus those suffering from the living death that is depression of satisfaction and contentment usually choose to further commit themselves
to some combination of the two motivating powers just enumerated in order to escape it and reenter their life with a fresh start.
<hr>
Nothing useful can be made without the construction of physical or mental walls. 
Only when the public land is divided into lots and privatized does it become economically viable. 
No building was ever built without differentiating the inside from the outside with some wall either physical or mental. 
Even the time available during the day was divided into hours, minutes, seconds, or microseconds before it was made useful.
<hr>
Contentment and satisfaction are the greatest enemy of independence. 
Yet independence is fundamentally necessary to achieve contentment and satisfaction. 
Thus we forge the weapons of our own demise.
<hr>
In Abrahamic religions (Christianity, Judaism, and Islam), you may be a bad person your entire life so long as you remember to apologize for it after the damage is done. 
In this manner do good people commit evil. 
Instead, one should always live their life and make decisions so that no apology will be necessary nor desired.
<hr>
Only when you climb to great heights can you fall to great depths. 
So if you want to avoid a great fall then you must avoid greatness altogether.
<hr>
Like a coin, there are always two sides to every story. 
Thus no tragedy occurs in isolation.
<hr>
The age of Colonialism never ended, its just been rebranded as globalization and foreign direct investment.
<hr>
Comparative advantage doesn’t necessarily mean specializing in something you’re good at, 
it means specializing in something that’s in demand and that others aren’t as specialized in. 
Comparative advantage is the true bond of a stable long term relationship. 
<hr>
If you provide people with a consistent meaning to actions regardless of truth they will acquiesce to your will.
All people have a fundamental desire to be useful to themselves and others. 
In 1770s America this was called the pursuit of happiness.
<hr>
Everybody dies.
<hr>
Every person always has the option to sustain, preserve, and defend themselves.
<hr>
As volume of interactions increases so does the risk of systems collapse. 
Consequently the best method of maintaining system integrity without enforcing complete isolation 
of the system’s elements is to maintain a federally organized system where most components are of a local nature 
and only the components necessary for the entire system to function are global in nature.
Thus local governance should be locally sourced and top level systemwide governance should be sourced from top level governance systems.
<hr>
Biologically, the creation of a new person is the product of the union of two other persons. 
Economically and ecologically, the creation of a new person is contingent on the availability of the resources necessary for the person’s sustainability. 
Consequently, when a system’s economic or carrying capacity is reached or surpassed, 
further creation is only possible after destruction has occurred. 
This is the natural result of too much supply and a shortage of demand.
So, value not just human life, but the death that makes it economically sustainable, 
the biological unions that create a new person, the economic incentives that encourage it, 
and the sexual unions that create not life, but social, personal, and economic benefits for the participants.
<hr>
The law only exists as far as the state is willing and capable of enforcing it.
<hr>
Fear rules the battlefield... and the economy... and all people in all stressful situations because, 
like wildlife running to escape a wildfire, humans are animals first and intelligent second. 
Thus no one is above fear. 
People are social and empathetic creatures, thus emotions like fear are virulently contagious amongst 
all that the cause of the emotion might reach. 
Likewise, intense self confidence and fearlessness in the face of that which is feared might also reach
all who come into contact with it and spread virulently. 
<hr>
There are two types of people: those that seek out authority figures and those that seek to become authority figures. 
Fortunately for the stability of society, most people are the former. 
<hr>
Why do we value life and fear death? Perhaps because economics tells us to. 
Everyone knows their time alive is limited and that death is inevitable for everyone and seemingly forever, 
therefore as the scarcer of the two life is deemed to have more value. 
Consequently by persuading people that there is life after death some religions and cults are able to 
convince people to freely give their lives by changing the scarcity of life. 
Does this mean that there isn’t actually life after death? 
Unfortunately for the living, that question can never be empirically answered. 
Of course this is where you must exercise your free will to decide what to believe. 
Do you choose to believe that lack of evidence for or against life after death means that there cannot be life after death? 
Or do you believe that there is something else waiting for you after you die? 
<hr>
I haven’t gone crazy, I’ve been there the whole time.
<hr>
The sole difference between play and work, is the perceived absence of risk during play.
Human motivations can be divided into 3 categories: 
-needs, driven by the goal of avoiding negative repercussions 
-desires, driven by the goal of receiving positive repercussions 
-wants, driven by the goals we set for ourselves 
Needs are the most powerful and the least controllable while wants are the least powerful and most controllable 
<hr>
By this point you’re probably trying to make sense of what sounds like the conflicting bipolar themes of 
anarchism and totalitarianism that I seem to be advocating. 
However, I’m not advocating anything yet. 
Recall that this section is titled Observations. 
Exploration of the balance between power, stability, economy, liberty, and human nature will occur later. 
Besides, these seemingly conflicting themes aren’t contradictory opposites but rather fundamental extremes of human nature. 
So you have to understand them if you want to understand normal humans. 
<hr>
What is government but a monopoly over monopolies? 
Through its monopolies of force, geographic administration, and morality through judicial administration a government can destroy, create, and manage monopolies at will.
<hr>
The elderly cling to life the same way children cling to their mother. 
Consequently their biggest fear, and the most necessary thing for them to do is to learn to let go.
<hr>
No shame: most people are drawn to people with no shame because most people have a lower opinion of themselves 
than they have of other people and instinctively want to be around people that don’t feel the shame of being themselves.
<hr>
The hardest prisons to escape are the ones without locks

Fortunately, the marginal cost of increasing the output of the press is lower than the marginal cost of a lawsuit 
<hr>
What makes humans distinct as a species? 
Like beavers we can manipulate our environment, but unlike beavers we can intentionally manipulate 
our environment in order to manipulate ourselves and each other. 
So to answer the question, our capacity for planning outstrips all our competitors
<hr>
There are two types of people: those whose individuality is diminished by being a member of a group, 
and those whose individuality is amplified by being a member of a group. 
The former get their sense of identity from the group, 
while the latter provide a sense of identity to the group. 
<hr>
When governments die, the structured societies that they governed return to the tribal societies that are the natural state of humanity.
Why? Because a structured society’s existence is predicated on the enforcement of property rights, 
irrespective of the existence of a free market. 
And though a free market might exist in tribal societies via barter, property rights do not.
<hr>
There are no rights, just privileges.
<hr>
The only difference between a marriage and a long term relationship is that a marriage has legal consequences and restrictions. 
Because governments ultimately exist to enforce the tradable monopoly of ownership called property rights 
and the primary legal consequence of marriage is a monopoly on your partner's relationships and economic future, 
then it follows that marriage is a form of ownership over another person’s relationships and economic future 
which comes at the price of their ownership over your relationships and economic future.
<hr>
Black holes are pieces of infinity condemned to perpetual loneliness.
<hr>
You can do whatever you want, you just have to know what it is.
<hr>
When we seek to destroy others we often hurt ourselves because it is the self that wants to be destroyed.
<hr>
Power is like gravity. 
Everything significant revolves around the greatest local entity.
Stars revolve around the black holes at the center of galaxies, planets revolve around the suns at the center of solar systems, and moons revolve around planets.
The stability of empires is dependent on the decisions made by leaders in their Capitols, ships travel around continents, and streets are paved around buildings.
Empires, cities, buildings, and ships are built around people and exist to serve the purposes that people choose for them.
Likewise, people maneuver themselves around the greatest local entities that are their leaders in pursuit of whatever personal advantages they can gain for themselves.
Even these leaders, in managing their power and distributing advantages, make their decisions around the most significant principles available to them.
<hr>
Stress increases the desire for sex, because sex reduces stress.
Having sex not only reduces stress for both partners, but results in improved health and longer lifespans.
Similarly to sex, marriage-like relationships reduce economic stress, though in this domain the mechanism is resource pooling and cost sharing rather than biology.
<hr>
Of the possible relationship types, the most traditional is the command type where the woman is commanded by the man.
<hr>
Laws are the speech and expressions of the state.
Fortunately, the impact of all words diminishes with time.
<hr>
To live without being loved is torture.
<hr>
Meditation is preparation for death.
Death is the release of your individuality, the transition from reality to unreality, and the conjunction of the isolated identity with the universal identity.
<hr>
The apparent separation of the universe into reality and unreality exists for the purpose of enabling the universe to escape the experience of loneliness by treating itself as a separate entity.
<hr>
Controlling people is only possible through fear. 
Fear is the foundation of order. 
You cannot decide people's fates and still be human. 
You can make people fear you directly, but then you only maintain order while you maintain the fear and you become a victim when it all collapses.
Or you can make people fear something else and use a combination of fear of it and hope and trust in you to control them.
However, the power of trust is wholly dependent and proportional to the power of their fear.
<hr>
Between freedom and food people always choose food.
<hr>
Everything is about sex except for sex itself.
Sex is about power and power is usually about control.
That's why the best sex requires taking control and the most provocative foreplay one can experience is being controlled.
<hr>
The more beautiful and controlled your appearance the more others assume that the purpose of the control is to hide something that you don't want to share.
The mystery of what could be valuable enough to justify this much effort in hiding from the world, implies to them that it must be worth uncovering.
<hr>
People follow the rules because they fear them, but also because they love them.
Make people both love and fear you and they will move the earth for you.
<hr>
Anyone can be superhuman if they can do a superhuman's job. But they can only be superhuman while they do that job or while they appear to be doing that job.
<hr>
The people are like a good leader. 
They are naturally passive and wait to see what a potential partner has to offer before choosing the best.
They never make the first step, but if they see a strong and confident leader then they lie under the leader at once.
Of course if they wait too long before choosing, then they miss out on the best and will frequently end up with the worst.
<hr>
Propaganda and advertising work not because of some psychological trick, 
but because people crave the comfort of the idea that there's someone else out there that they can trust to look out for them.
<hr>
It is natural to fear death, and the only way to stop fearing it is to make peace with it, accept it as inevitable, 
and live your life in such a way that if you lived it again you would make all the same decisions.
<hr>
There are two types of people: those that are like a ball and those that are like an egg.
At some point in their life everyone will hit a wall or rock bottom and they can either bounce off it or let it shatter them.
What happens all depends on how flexible they can be while still holding themselves together.
<hr>
Any religion founded on blood is a monster.
The more it is fed, the more it will demand.
Only when the supply of blood dries up will the monster dry up too.
<hr>
Even revolutions follow the laws of economics. 
If there is no market for one then no one will buy in, and what all revolutions truly need to be successful is to become a monopoly.
<hr>
Humanism never wins any wars.
<hr>
The path to victory does not always mean moving forward.
You must be able to maneuver, stop, and wait.
<hr>
God is the Universe. 
People are pieces of the universe. 
Therefore people are pieces of God, and your God is only as great as your Community. 
<hr>
Pure capitalism is like a fire.
The faster it burns the more light it produces, but it leaves nothing but ashes in its wake.
Pure community is like a garden; with enough care and some water everything may bloom.
Society is a balance coexistence between capitalism and community.
Let the fire burn out of control and it will leave the world in darkness and ashes.
Let the water flood the garden or fail to provide enough water and nothing will grow choking out the fire and leaving the world just as barren and dark.
<hr>
There is no revolution that has survived a committee.
<hr>
Long ago, King Frederick II of the Holy Roman Empire hoped to find out what the natural language of humanity was.
So he conducted an experiment to see what would happen if children were raised completely without human interaction.
He locked away some newborns somewhere where nobody would disturb them and
had some nurses feed and care for them, but forbid the nurses from speaking to the children.
All the children died, thus demonstrating that humans are inherently social creatures that fundamentally 
need to communicate to each other.
<hr>
There's a fine line between enlightenment and insanity called social acceptance.
This is because enlightenment is just a socially acceptable form of insanity.
<hr>
What makes the nobility so noble anyway? They have tenure.
<hr>
In economics, humanity has discovered every society's principal medium of power.
<hr>
Truth is everywhere, but can only be revealed by lies.
<hr>
You are always free to behave as you please and make any decision, but you are never free of the consequences of doing so. Thus freedom is its own prison of tyranny.
<hr>
The wealthy prefer the fantasy of candlelight as romantic, rather than the truth of deteriorating public utilities.
<hr>
Dating is when you think you're going to have sex, but then you don't have sex.
<hr>
If you don't feel compelled to befriend someone regardless of if you will be having sex or not, then your relationship is going to be all about sex and nothing more.
<hr>
Utilitarianism is just the philosophication of capitalism. Likewise, the utility monster is the philosophication of a monopoly.
<hr>
Identity is acquired by the individual for the sake of the community and is thus inherently a social creation. 
Yet an individual needs an identity like they need air because people are inherently social animals. 
Without identity the soul has nothing holding it back from reuniting with and being reabsorbed into the soul of the universe.
This is why achieving nirvana ends the cycle of reincarnation. 
<hr>
Manliness: truthfulness, fearlessness, duty/sacrifice, loyalty, self-sacrifice.
<hr>
Never forget that money is a means to an end, and should never be the end itself.
Those who do will suffer from the despair of decadence.
<hr>
The future begins where history and tradition end.
<hr>
Sophistication is the enemy of progress.
Luxury is the enemy of discipline.
Entitlement is the enemy of fearlessness.
<hr>
No person is above sacrifice.
<hr>
Sentience is that which can experience and respond to itself.
<hr>
Death is the removal of the hand of the soul from the puppet of reality.
<hr>
In the beginning there was nothing and only nothing. 
Thus nothing was everything. 
Then everything, being all there was, became lonely and bored with its omnipotence over itself. 
So it began to divide itself so that it would no longer be alone and could experience meropotence.
At first it divided in half into reality and unreality and then as it continued to divide, reality came into focus and space, time, energy, and the rest of the universe were realized.
As time went on the universe continued to divide and realize finer details within itself.
<hr>
Never let good problems stand in the way of solving bad problems.
<hr>
Like gravity, love is one of the fundamental forces of the universe.
Love for oneself, love for others, and love for god.
These are all the same love because we are each a physical manifestation of god.
<hr>
God does not work in mysterious ways, God works in your ways, because you are an extension of God.
<hr>
The age of tolerance is over. Now begins the age of acceptance.
<hr>
Every individual has four fundamental nonphysical needs: meaning, love, achievement, and communication.
<hr>
There are two paths to the future:
-The path of growth where the future is acheived by transforming the present
-The path of destruction where the future is acheived by destroying the present
Choose wisely.
<hr>
There are only two possible paths to unity: common interest and common fear.
Likewise there are only two paths to disunity: divided interest and divided fear.
A divided house cannot support itself.
<hr>
There are 4 types of meditation which are linked to the four spiritual needs.
Meditation is a type of ritual.
Ritual works by creating a spiritual todo list for your soul to complete when it passes on to unreality. 
In unreality it can move beyond time to meet with the other souls you encounter in reality and persuade them to influence your reality when they journey through it.
<hr>
Most truths are made ugly because people don't want to hear them.
<hr>
By the time decay has set in, it is too late for maintenance and renewal can only be acheived through destruction and recreation.
Thus the paradox of maintenance is that it is only effective when it appears to be unnecessary.
<hr>
Meditation is the cultivation and harvesting of truths.
<hr>
Death is easier than life.
<hr>
Just like you, the enemy is always right because you are each pursuing your own preferred flavors of the truest truths.
<hr>
Progress is painful, but despair is regression.
<hr>
Contribution is the seed of commitment, but contradiction is the seed of conflict.
So to those who preach or evangelize: do not tell them what to think; tell them the truth and listen to what they think of it.
For two thousand years this has been the principle behind the Socratic method.
<hr>
Write, recite, realize. This is the process of transferring ideas into reality.
<hr>
The sustainable indulgence is natural and necessary, but the extravagant decadence is unnatural and self defeating.
<hr>
If your enemy attacks from the sun, fight in the shade.
<hr>
Let go of the past, it can never be changed and slows you down; rather pursue the future, for it can always be changed.
<hr>
Being a leader is knowing where you're needed the most and going there to help.
<hr>
To master any discipline you must master discipline itself.
<hr>
You think you're the first person to think your war is justified? 
Countless others have come before you, claiming they're the real victims and their enemy is the real evil.
<hr>
Never make a promise you won't keep.
Never make a threat you're not willing to carry out yourself.
Never advertise a service that you can't deliver.
<hr>
All freedoms are built on a foundation of discipline and power.
<hr>
The shadows of the past can be felt by the present.
<hr>
Masculinity is the resonance of a person's identity with their inner drive and energy.
Femininity is the resonance of a person's identity with their masculinity and their community.
<hr>
Every child needs someone to love and nurture them so they can learn to love and nurture themselves.
Every child needs someone to be a caring authority figure to them so that they can learn to not be threatened by authority and how to assert themselves in a nonthreatening manner.
<hr>
Only by making the cost of complacency unacceptably high, can you make the choice between action and complacency productive.
<hr>
The existence of god is neither provable nor disprovable. 
Consequently it takes just as much faith for atheists to believe that there is no god as it does for theists to believe that there is one. 
Even agnostics have faith that reality will give them proof of the truth, whatever that might be. 
Therefore while not all people have faith in a religion or deity, they all have metafaith. 
That is they have faith that they can trust whatever it is that they do put their faith in. 
Thus the only thing we need to have faith in is faith itself.
<hr>
Everyone needs to have a purpose in the community so that they have a sense of social security and understand the value that they bring to the community.
<hr>
Fear of pain is more useful than pain itself.
<hr>
All protests, riots, and civil unrest require two things for people to join them: a reason to participate in them and the time to participate.
Consequently we see increases in civil unrest whenever unemployment increases significantly past its normal level.
Unfortunately, once the unrest starts it cannot be stopped by simply addressing the reason for its existence as people get caught up in the unrest itself.
Thus the only way to end the unrest peacefully is to provide people with something else to do instead of participating in the unrest.
<hr>
All carrot and no stick makes Jack a dull boy. 
All stick and no carrot makes Jack a martyr.
<hr>
Authority can be neither taken, given, nor taught. 
It can only be projected by those who know how. 
Authority, like stone, is unyielding and practical. 
Mercy, like water, is cool, pleasant, and healing.
Fear, like fire, is destructive and aggressive, and spreads quickly in dry environments.
Communication, like air, is either essential or useless depending on how it is used.
<hr>
Balance is precarious. Equilibrium is self sustaining.
<hr>
It seems that the fundamental difference between tribal cultures and other cultures is that in tribal cultures the superior party is culpable for the outcomes caused by the inferior parties,
while in other cultures the relevant inferior party is culpable for the outcomes caused by the superior party.
Ultimately, it is this delegation of culpability to the superior party that enables a culture to sustain institutions over the long term.
<hr>
Handling protesters in the short term is simply a matter of ignoring them until they start harming nonprotesters and destroying property, 
then treating them like criminals because they have behaved like criminals.
Handling protesters in the long term is about actively addressing the concerns they have raised.
Failure to address their concerns in the long run will result in the protests snowballing into a rebellion.
<hr>
All laws are general in the sense that they are created in order to standardize or institutionalize a government's handling of a specific situation and therefore serve the government.
However, all politics is local because as individuals, people are inherently and naturally too self interested to care about the law the way the government does.
Since the government is ultimately always composed of people, the march of time gradually erodes the true purpose of the 
laws made from serving the government to serving the people that control the government.
As such, the laws and institutions of government can only stand the test of time when they are designed to serve both the government and those who control the government. 
This is the logic that historically has always led to the formation of monarchies; and history shows that monarchies are both more stable and long lasting than virtually all republics.
The only monarchies that collapse due to solely internal reasons, do so because the institutions of government 
stopped serving both the government (the monarch) and themselves (the people that support or constitute the government).
In fact, natural republics are usually formed in response to the behavior or collapse of a monarchy where the people no longer trust a monarch because of the monarch's failure to serve them.
In contrast, natural monarchies are formed in response to the behavior or collapse of a republic where people no 
longer trust the leadership selection process of the republic to provide trustworthy leaders that will serve them.
It is evident that those who drafted and wrote the 1789 constitution of the United States of America understood this as they clearly stated during the constitutional convention 
that they regretted that the conditions were not right for the establishment of a monarchy since the colonies had just revolted against one.
<hr>
It is easier to beleive in others than it is to beleive in yourself.
Only when others beleive in you can you truly beleive in yourself because you beleive them.
This apparent paradox is called community or solidarity.
This paradox is also responsible for the fact that people usually choose to engage in prosocial behavior even when there is no benefit to themselves. 
In other words people have to put effort into being selfish.
<hr>
As far as each individual is concerned there are two types of people in the world: givers and takers.
Those who seek to benefit your individual power are givers.
Those who seek to benefit from your individual power are takers.
Because people may switch between these depending on context it is vital that the individual learns to identify 
which a person currently is so that they may prevent the takers from taking from their private lives.
<hr>
All paths lead to the truth, but some are longer than others.
<hr>
In a free market all resources are distributed with perfect efficiency and the prices of products are determined by the market not the firms.
However, free markets only apply to firms that offer identical products. 
Once there is a significant differentiation between products, the free market becomes a monopolistically competitive market.
Unfortunately for the buyers, the firms in a free market are naturally incentivized to make the market monopolistically competitive in order to increase the firm's profitability.
In their quest for higher profits, some firms will eventually succeed at becoming monopolies because monopolies generate the highest amount of profit for the firm.
Eventually, these monopolies lose their competitive advantage since it is no longer required to generate the profits necessary to keep 
the firm in existence, and at some point the uncompetitive monopoly will collapse under the weight of its own inefficiency. 
This collapse will usually bring anarchy to the market and in response or anticipation of this scenario the firm will be 
nationalized by another firm or the government for the sake of restoring order or preventing chaos.
Because individuals are fundamentally economic entities, the same progression occurs in political markets as well. 
Thus when examining the distribution of political power in societies over time, irrespective of whether the society is 
governed by a monarch or republic, we see the same progression that Plato described in his five regimes.
This progression begins with the "philosopher-king"(s) which founded the society, followed by a period of rule by a timocracy (the land owners) 
in which the distribution of political opportunity is relatively equal and the political market is a free market.
This later degenerates into an oligarchy of some sort where there are barriers to entry to the political market making it a monopolistically competitive market.
Eventually the forces of competitive self interest transform the oligarchy into what Plato called a democracy, but is actually just the monopolization of the 
political market by one entity which now has the freedom to operate without political competition and therefore consequences.
Plato's democracy then deteriorates into what he calls tyranny where the monopoly collapses as a result of its uncompetitiveness 
resulting in anarchy followed by the seizure of power by a tyrant for the sake of restoring order.

We ourselves, construct the walls that trap us, and in doing so dig our own graves.
In the wars within our self there are no winners, because when we are our own greatest enemy we can only inflict defeat and sufferin upon our self.
Thus the only solution is to tear down the walls within our self, make peace with and accept all the parts of who we are no matter how 
distasteful or frightening, and find ways to express these parts of ourselves in productive ways.
<hr>
The more you promise, the less you deliver.
<hr>
Loneliness is the despair you feel when you don't have a relationship to focus on.
Solitude is the tranquility you feel when you have a relationship with your self.
<hr>
The one thing every person craves from others is validation.
Validation of who they are, validation of their acceptance by their community, and validation of their actions.
<hr>
A purpose of life is communicating love.
<hr>
Nobody gets to decide whether to suffer or not. 
Everyone gets to decide how they react to their suffering.
<hr>
A stable government requires a stable society, but a stable society does not require a stable government.
<hr>
If you ask someone what they want, you'll get an answer based in fantasy.
If you ask them what they want to avoid though, you'll get an answer based in reality.

It is always easier to rely on someone else's authority than your own.

Before you can build a house, you must lay its foundation. 
Before you can lay a foundation, you must prepare the site upon which it is to be laid.
<hr>
When you want to accomplish something that you can't accomplish yourself there are only two possible courses of action.
You can have it done for you, which is the easier option.
Or you can someone help you to do it together, which is the best option because it offers you an opportunity for both personal growth and interpersonal connection.
<hr>
English is the only language where you don’t have feelings because you ARE feelings.
People don't say "I have a hunger", they say "I AM hungry". 
Because the language we speak and think in shapes the way we think, this discourages us from admitting that we are feeling 
negative emotions because saying "I AM lonely" is like admitting defeat because we have become loneliness itself.
And since our pride won't let us admit to being defeated by an emotion, we simply don't acknowledge when we feel negative emotions. 
However, when we instead say "I FEEL lonely" or "I HAVE loneliness", we acknowledge the feeling without letting the feeling win against our ego.
<hr>
The absence of context is context.
<hr>
When you practice being bored you stop being bored, because you now have something to focus on.
This means that being bored is the only thing that you can't get better at.
<hr>
In America the history of white supremacy has always been dependent on the financial supremacy of white people and until the rich start investing in the poor 
at loss no law, protest, mass shooting, or civil war will be enough to end racism.
