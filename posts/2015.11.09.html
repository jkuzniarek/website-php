Another project assigned during the Programming II course using Java was the
Tax Accountant Project. We were given a description of how the tax brackets
functioned as well as how the project was intended to output the end results. The
program takes in information about taxpayers' income, deductions, and the state
and federal taxes witheld. It then calculates each taxpayer's state and federal
refunds. Check out the output below.
