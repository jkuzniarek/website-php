During the COP 2930 Programming II course using Java, we were assigned a project
  in which we were to write a program that performed a card trick. We were supplied
  with a video demonstrating the card trick and also given instructions on how
  the card trick functions. The 'trick' is for the dealer (the program) to
  guess which card the participant selects at the beginning. Check out the output below.
