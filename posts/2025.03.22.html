  <h1><em>The SRV Design Pattern</em></h1>

      When it comes to web development I've always found the MVC design pattern to be cumbersome.
      Though this impression could easily be a byproduct of my experience working with Object Oriented MVC websites in particular, 
      even my own attempts to organize websites using the MVC design pattern without object oriented code 
      have been handicapped by the unavoidable client-server architecture of the web.
      This is not to say that web developers should abandon the MVC pattern, afterall modern programs cannot not exist without it.
      The essence of the issue is simply that the MVC pattern is only suitable for monolithic systems, 
      and websites that exist beyond the standalone html page intrinsicly consist of multiple distinct 
      and networked systems on both sides of the client server dichotomy.</p>
    <p>
      At first I tried various ways of partitioning the Models, Views, and Controllers between client and server. 
      However, I eventually realized that not only could these elements appear in either category, but they frequently appeared in both.
      Then I tried to come up with a variant of the MVC pattern by swapping out one or two of the patterns components 
      for other categories of components commonly used in websites.
      I reasoned that even though an html page could clearly be just a view, it could also operate as a controller like in a Single Page web App (SPA).
      This also requires a server-side controller-like endpoint to interact with whatever server-side resources are needed by the client though.</p>
    <p>
      Strangely enough, the solution came to me while I was researching a way to utilize ReactJS without 
      either setting up a NodeJS server or embedding a 1 MB Javascript file into my html page.
      I learned that the developers of ReactJS and similar technologies are all resorting to server-side rendering, 
      most likely because it's the only way they know how to reliably develop a complex web application while still organizing their code in a MVC pattern.
      It was at that point that I knew that the MVC pattern was simply and thoroughly unsuited to web development 
      on its own because it was intended for monolithic entities only. 
      Ultimately, I found that the client-server dichotomy's namesake analogy was the optimal starting point for the multilithic design pattern that is enumerated below.</p>

    <h2>SRV (Services, Resources, and Views)</h2>
    <p>
      The components of the SRV pattern occupy the conceptual spaces that are perpendicular to the components of the MVC pattern.
      While this design pattern is described and intended for websites, it can theoretically be adapted to other networked architectures 
      where the user interface and the agent governing resource access are not a single monolithic entity.
      The MVC pattern should not be entirely abandoned however, because it remains a crucial means of 
      constructing each of the three SRV components when your design needs to support more complicated features.</p>
      
    <p>By extending the aforementioned client-server analogy to other restaurant elements we can simply explain the components of the SRV pattern:</p>
      
    <h4>The Views of our application are analogous to the Menus of a restaurant.</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>These are the principal user interfaces of the application, and like a menu should be built with the expectation 
        that the users will inspect it closely and subject it to a wide variety of unexpected behaviors.</li>
      <li>In web development, these are typically HTML, CSS, and JS files; but they are also any file that may be 
        sent to a browser unaltered when requested directly by URL.</li>
      <li>These files are stored in a typical directory tree which is exposed to the user through their browser for reading only, 
        but can also accommodate a SPA website if desired by the developer.</li></ul>
      
    <h4>The Resources of our application are analogous to the Recipes & Ingredients used to fill customer requests.</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>These are the common server-side resources like templates, libraries, objects, database connections, 
        cache, config, and data files available to only the server to use and execute.</li>
      <li>In web development, these are typically ENV, JSON, CSV, and DAT files.</li>
      <li>These files are stored in a dedicated "resources" directory which should not be exposed to the user at all.</li></ul>
      
    <h4>The Services of our application are analogous to the Workers in a restaurant that attempt to fill each customer's requests.</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>These fill the REST requests made by the Views of the application using the Resources designated by the developer.</li>
      <li>In web development, these can be PHP files or more frequently the request handling executable of the application server itself.</li>
      <li>These files are stored in a dedicated "services" directory which should be exposed to the user for server-side execution only.</li></ul>
