I was recently asked by my mother how easy it was to "spin up a server" and would she be able to do it for her small business.
She told me that she had seen ads online saying it was so easy that it could be done in a few minutes. 
I spent the next 15 minutes explaining to her that if she wants a website for her business she should have a web developer (such as myself)
build it for her rather than her try to build it herself. My mom does not work in the IT industry.

<p>
That's not to say that she isn't computer literate (she is), 
but this conversation reminded me of the disconnect between those that work in the IT industry and those that we refer to as "Users".
For Users, computers are like magic and the people in IT are like witches and wizards. 
They don't understand how computers work, and as a result they don't understand the limitations to what their local witch or wizard can do.
To them we can fix their computer, and make the next Facebook, and turn their idea into an app, and hack into the Pentagon while sipping coffee at Starbucks.
Though I blame the misconception about our hacking abilities on Hollywood, 
the problem as I see it is that the only experience the user has with computers is through whatever User Interface (UI) they're interacting with.
By design, the users never actually get to see what's behind the curtain (the UI), 
and when they do they might not even realize it (remember customizing MySpace with CSS?).

Despite a growing awareness of the mystical properties of Code, users still have difficulty recognizing the diversity within the IT industry, 
never mind differentiating between its fields.
This prompted me to come up with an approximate outline of the IT industry in order to bring users some illumination on the subject. 
The following is an approximate representation of the fields and their subfields within the Information Technology Industry.

Each of these items effectively represents a separate career path.

Though every one of these fields is deserving of its own degree program, 
few actually have them due to the speed of change and development in this industry.
