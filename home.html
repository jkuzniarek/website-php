<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>
  I originally built this website as a portfolio project many years ago, 
  but it has evolved through several iterations as both my skills and interests have changed since then.
  The primary purpose of these rebuilds has always been to expand my knowledge and web development experience 
  by trying out new technologies and now it also provides a place for me to share some of my thoughts and projects with the world.
  Most recently though, I've rebuilt it to exhibit a new design pattern I've come up with which I call 
  <a href="#posts/2025.03.22">SRV</a> (Services, Resources, and Views). 
</p>
<p>
  My interests include various topics such as: 
  anthropology, urban planning, mass transit, history, philosophy, hiking, reading, and of course information science.
  Many of these subjects interest me due to my fascination with systems
  analysis and design combined with my propensity to examine both the impact of the
  perspectives people hold on their actions and decisions, and the
  cascading effects that can occur from small changes to a system.
  To learn more I suggest exploring my posts and projects.
